# The Sparks Foundation Internship Tasks

# Task 2 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of
marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear
regression task as it involves just two variables.

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a
day?

# Task 3 - To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of
clusters and represent it visually.

# Task 4 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

# Task 5 - To explore Business Analytics

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset
‘SampleSuperstore’.

You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see
how your company is performing. You are interested in finding
out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

What all business problems you can derive by looking into the
data? You can choose any of the tool of your choice
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
